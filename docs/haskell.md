## Why Learn Haskell?
**1.	Functional Paradigm:** Haskell encourages a different way of thinking about problems by emphasizing functions, immutability, and expressions over statements.  
**2.	Type Safety:** Its strong, static type system helps catch errors at compile time, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.  
**3.	Concise and Expressive:** Haskell's syntax is clean and expressive, allowing complex ideas to be conveyed in fewer lines of code.  
**4.	Lazy Evaluation:** Haskell uses lazy evaluation by default, meaning expressions are only evaluated when needed. This allows for powerful abstractions and performance optimizations.  
**5.	Academic and Industry Adoption:** While initially popular in academia, Haskell has seen increasing adoption in industry, especially in domains requiring high reliability and correctness, such as finance, compilers, and web development.
